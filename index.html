            <h3>The space</h3>
            <p>
              The studio features a generous live room with a PA system, a diverse range
              of amplifiers, an 8-piece drum kit, keyboards of various types and some
              speciality instruments such as a wind organ.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the separate live room, we have a Logic-based recording setup featuring an
              Allen & Heath mixer and a PreSonus Quantum audio interface. We are currently
              capable of recording up to 8 channels concurrently, and the community centre has
              a fast Internet connection, perfect for livestreaming directly from the studio.
